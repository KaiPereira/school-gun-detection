# School Gun Detection

Every 72 hours, there are approximately 200 shootings in the US. That's absurd and needs to stop. https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/last-72-hours

For royal bay hacks, I wanted to create a solution for school shootings to help save young lives!

## How it works

The system uses 3 different detection methods and a dashboard for government purposes:

### Cameras

Cameras would be placed inside of schools to detect gun being brought in and call 911. 
This would be the first line of defense.

### Audio

Based off decibels (Would love to train a model to do this though) it would detect gun shot decibel levels, compare them to gunshot audios and then call the police.
This is the second line of defense.

### Dashboard

I've also created a dashboard where all the calls to 911 and why will show up to, this can help with rare false-calls and governement use purposes.

## Features I would love to add

Not everything I said here was implemented in the 10 hours given, some things I'd like to implement are:

- Gunshot audio ml detection
- Better dashboard
- Better camera detection
- Building a first iteration hardware device that incorporates all of these
- So much more!
